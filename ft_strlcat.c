/*DESCRIPTION
    The strlcat() function copies and concatenates strings respectively. They are
    designed to be safer, more consistent, and less error prone replacements for
    strncpy(3) and strncat(3). Unlike those functions, strlcat() takes the full
    size of the buffer (not just the length) and guarantee to NUL-terminate the
    result (as long as size is larger than 0 or, in the case of strlcat(), as long
    as there is at least one byte free in dst). Note that a byte for the NUL should
    be included in size. Also note that strlcpy() and strlcat() only operate on true
    “C” strings. This means that for strlcpy() src must be NUL-terminated and for
    strlcat() both src and dst must be NUL-terminated.

    The strlcat() function appends the NUL-terminated string src to the end of dst.
    It will append at most size - strlen(dst) - 1 bytes, NUL-terminating the result.

RETURN VALUES
    The strlcpy() and strlcat() functions return the total length of the string they
    tried to create. For strlcpy() that means the length of src. For strlcat() that
    means the initial length of dst plus the length of src. While this may seem somewhat
    confusing, it was done to make truncation detection simple.

    Note, however, that if strlcat() traverses size characters without finding a NUL, the
    length of the string is considered to be size and the destination string will not be
    NUL-teminated (since there was no space for the NUL). This keeps strlcat() from running
    off the end of a string.  In practice this should not happen (as it means that either
    size is incorrect or that dst is not a proper “C” string). The check exists to prevent
    potential security problems in incorrect code.
